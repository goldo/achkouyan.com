Hi, I'm Franck 🖐️

I'm a remote 🌍 freelance javascript developer 👨‍💻 based in Paris 🇫🇷 and specialized in Node, React & GraphQL. I'm 30, and I've been developing since I was 14 👶

I went to [@efrei_paris 📚](https://twitter.com/efrei_paris) engineer school

Then, I co-founded [@BloomeeFr 📱](https://twitter.com/bloomeefr) (crowd-sourced quiz on mobile native & web) and [@GamificTV 📺](https://twitter.com/gamifictv) (play on your mobile, audio-synchronized with your live TV show)

I've been doing native mobile development 📱 (iOS & Android) for 4 years before becoming a javascript developer 🌐 (front & back)

I've worked for 3 years at [@LeMondeFR 📰](https://twitter.com/LeMondeFR) on the Content Management System ✍️ using Node, GraphQL, React and Angular

I strongly believe in simple, clean and efficient technologies 🖥️ the famous "Do One Thing and Do It Well" ✅

I'm sensitive to current privacy 🔏 issues, and willing to do more

In 2017 I became a vegetarian 🥕 because I'm convinced we can stay fit 💪 without hurting animals 🐮 and polluting less 🌱

I also love video gaming 🎮 and playing football ⚽️
